# Mixed-Words
Mixed words is a python game created by me, PrimeDev, aka leoprimesmatrix.

# How do you play?
In order to play Mixed words, you must have Python 3 installed on your computers and other modules.

# How do I install Python and its requirements?
First visit the following website (Official Website): https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once that, complete the Python setup to continue.

# Installing Modules
To run the game, you will need the following modules called: random, time, and colorama. To install these modules, you must open up your Command Prompt on your Computer, I'll explain below both for Mac and Windows (I'm not sure if this works for Linux.)

# Installing On Windows
First, go to your search bar below:

Then, search Command Prompt, you will have it as it come installed on your computer.

Once that, press Enter. In the Command Prompt, type the following things by turns:

pip install requests

pip install random

pip install colorama

pip install time

It should download all required modules to play the game.

# Installing on Mac

The same steps as above but on Mac, press CMD + SPACE to search for any application, in there, Search Terminal.

Then, install the modules or python3 and install them, I am not too sure on Mac since I have moved to windows. But it should work on mac too, just install Python and complete the setup.

# Running the game

On windows, go back to Command Prompt, and press enter once found. Then, unzip the downloaded file from github here. After that, place it on Desktop, or wherever you'd like (Desktop would be easier).

Once completed, on Command Prompt, type the following:

cd Desktop
then
cd (your file name)
and finally
python3 mixed_words.py

and done! You've runned the game! Congrats.

# Mac

On mac it should be the same except some things different, but everything should work fine.

# More about the game
The game is brand new, expect lots of bugs and fixes, patch notes will be posted soon on this page.

Thanks for playing, Enjoy!
